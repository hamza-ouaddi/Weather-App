# Weather-App
A weather app project that made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I used a Weather Api from "OpenWeatherMap", and I linked it with the application so that it can give the user the weather information about a specific city.

<ul>
  <li>To use the application, you either type the city name, or by allowing the application to detect your location.</li>
  <li>The application shows the tempurature degree, the description of the weather, how it feels like, and the humidity.</li>
  <li>In addition, the webpage background changes depending on the weather, as well as the icon.</li>  
</ul>
